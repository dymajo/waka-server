This is the Waka API documentation! We think this is a great API, and you can use it if you want to build your own app with our data.

## Advantages

- Unified API for all the cities we support. When we add another city, you get another city.
- Extremely fast. It's up to 10x faster than Auckland Transport's API.
- You don't have to bother with separate API keys for all agencies.
- Easy to use!

## Terms of Use

- Don't abuse the service - there's no API keys yet, so be nice.
- **Please do not build another real time board mobile app.** Making something like a smartwatch app, Facebook Messenger bot, or a realtime sign is fine. However if you want to build an app, we would appreciate if you just contributed to Waka directly <https://github.com/dymajo/waka>

## Weird Things

- Bits of the API are inconsistent, but we're trying to make things better.
- You can't currently get a list of all the available regions.

If you're using this in production, we would appreciate if you could [contact us](https://dymajo.com) first. Other than that, happy hacking!
